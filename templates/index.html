  <h2>Why this is secure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scan-gated downloads (pending, clean, quarantined)</li>
    <li>SHA-256 integrity checks on uploaded bytes</li>
    <li>RBAC and ownership checks to prevent IDOR</li>
    <li>Rate limits and quotas to reduce abuse</li>
    <li>Audit logs with metadata and redaction-safe details</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Demo limits:</strong> files are temporary, max upload size is 10MB, and you should not upload sensitive data.
