# Secure File Upload Service (Skeleton)

Scaffold for a FastAPI-based secure upload service with MinIO, Postgres, Redis, RQ, and basic CI.

- Start stack: `docker compose up --build`
- Run linters/tests locally: `make lint && make test`
- Alembic migrations: `make revision`, `make migrate`

Implementation is intentionally stubbed with TODOs.
